# apex pos

This repository contains some of earliest code that I have written. I spent high school working in restuarants and everyone always
complained about the POS system, so this was one of several attempts to create a better POS system. At the time, my skill level was
nowhere near where it needed to be in order to create the POS system I envisioned, so I ran into a deadend and haven't touched the code in
a long time. Planning, like in all of my early projects, had a great impact on how much progress I made.
